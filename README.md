## Introduction
So.. Thats my portfolio webpage :) Feel free to go in there. 
Why "one commit repo"? Because i didn't know, that there are some kind of "free hosting" at GitHub, so i was paying for my domain and hosting.. and i really wasn't thinking about making repo, with this site, since im not good at frontend, and there is nothing to show really.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JS
